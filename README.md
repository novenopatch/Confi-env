# DevScript

DevScript is a versatile command-line tool written in Go that streamlines the setup of development environments by automating the execution of various commands. It allows you to configure and run environment-specific commands with ease.

## Dev Prerequisites 

- Go (for building the executable)
- Bash (for Unix-like systems)
- Windows Terminal (for Windows users)

## Dev Installation

To build the DevScript executable, run the following command:

```bash

```

## Configuration

DevScript uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) to manage environment-specific commands. Customize the file according to your development needs.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "environments": {
    "web": ["mysqld", "httpd"],
    "mobile": ["flutter run"],
    "python": ["python server.py"]
  },
  "common_command": "wt -d C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\\dev"
}
```

## Usage

Run DevScript with the desired environment as an argument to execute specific commands:

```bash
./script web
```

This will launch MySQL (`mysqld`) and Apache HTTP Server (`httpd`), and open a Windows Terminal in the development directory.
